# code-refactor
## Description
This project took existing code and allowed me to practice refactoring. This process makes the code easier to read and design look clean without jeopardizing the functionality of the code. This was done by adding semancic tags to provide more descriptive meaning compared to the <div> tags that do not really tell other users or the computer much information about the content elements. I also added alts to images to help improve the experience for people who use screen readers which means the website can support our users from different backgrounds while also improving the Search Engine Optimization. Lastly, I had changed the naming of element, id, and class tags with the css file to match the changes made within the paired HTML file. The comments add better understanding as to what each css do for the website.
